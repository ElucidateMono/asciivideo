# asciivideo
Unoptimised trash-tier Python code that converts videos into videos but like ASCII art instead.

I'm probably never going to come back to this code again and make it useable, so please take a look at the lines below.
These are present at the bottom of the file, and the "test.avi" should be replaced with the path to the video.

```Python
#This is at the very bottom the file
fps = video_to_images("test.avi") #Replace "test.avi" with the path to the video
video_images_to_ascii()
third_stage()
final_stage(fps)
```
